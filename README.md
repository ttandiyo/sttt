# STTT

A two-player game written with Vite, Preact, HTML, and CSS. It takes the basic premise of tic-tac-toe and soups it upâ€”the board is larger, and the winner is determined by whoever has the most lines of 3-in-a-row at the end of the game. Also, you only have 5 seconds before a random move is made on your behalf!
